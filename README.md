# vesselsegmentation
This is a deep learning-based pipline for automatic extracting vessels from 3D microscopy images of human glioma cleared samples. The publication about this source code is 'Three-dimensional visualization of blood vessels in human gliomas based on tissue clearing and deep learning'. The code contains four parts: preprocessing, 3D U-Net segmentation, post-processing, and quantification of 3D vascular images.
